Please run the following codes in Console/Shell

For Bagging:

Example
:
python3 /path/to/your/data [5,10] 3

argv[1] = path to the data set

argv[2] = number of base tree

argv[3] = k fold CV



For Random Forest:

(the number of feature is 1 to 33, there is one feature that is totally zero)

Example:

python3 /path/to/your/data [1,2,3,4,33] 3

argv[1] = path to the data set

argv[2] = number of features

argv[3] = k fold CV
